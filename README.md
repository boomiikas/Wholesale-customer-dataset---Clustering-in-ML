# Wholesale Customers Dataset Analysis  

This project explores the **Wholesale Customers Dataset** to understand customer purchasing behavior and patterns across different product categories. The analysis is performed in a **Jupyter Notebook** and an interactive **Gradio (Hugging Face)** app.  

ðŸ”— **Live App:** [Wholesale Customer Clustering](https://huggingface.co/spaces/boomiikas/Wholesale-customer-clustering)

## Dataset  

The dataset contains annual spending by clients of a wholesale distributor across various product categories.  

**Columns:**  
- `Channel` â†’ Type of distribution channel (e.g., Horeca, Retail)  
- `Region` â†’ Customerâ€™s geographical region  
- `Fresh` â†’ Spending on fresh products  
- `Milk` â†’ Spending on milk products  
- `Grocery` â†’ Spending on grocery items  
- `Frozen` â†’ Spending on frozen products  
- `Detergents_Paper` â†’ Spending on detergents and paper products  
- `Delicassen` â†’ Spending on delicatessen items  

---

## Key Steps in Analysis  

- Data loading and basic exploration with **Pandas**  
- Checking unique values in `Channel` and `Region`  
- Summary statistics of spending patterns  
- Visualization of distributions using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  
- Correlation analysis between product categories  
- Insights into customer segmentation and behavior

## Tech Stack  

- **Python 3**  
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** â†’ Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â†’ Data visualization  
- **Streamlit** â†’ Interactive web application

# Clustering Analysis  

To identify customer segments, three clustering algorithms were applied on the **Wholesale Customers Dataset** after scaling the features:  

- **KMeans Clustering**  
- **Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)**  
- **DBSCAN**  

The performance was evaluated using the **Silhouette Score**.

## Results  

| Algorithm    | Silhouette | Clusters | Outliers | Cluster Sizes              |
|--------------|------------|----------|----------|----------------------------|
| KMeans       | 0.244      | 3        | 0        | {0: 209, 1: 149, 2: 82}    |
| Hierarchical | 0.243      | 3        | 0        | {0: 265, 1: 126, 2: 49}    |
| DBSCAN       | -1.000     | 0        | 18       | {0: 422}                   |
